SA algorithm has been implemented using MATLAB using a desktop PC with Intel® Core ™ i7-2620M, 2.7 GHz, 16.00 GB RAM, and a 64-bit Operating System. The optimal solution has been obtained after running several runs with different markov chain length with sizes varying from 50 -100 and it takes around 4-6 hours for a run to converge.
